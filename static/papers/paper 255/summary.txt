sometimes a better option might be for the driver to go to an area that is slightly less popular where people are making many short local trips which would accumulate to a handsome sum over the course of the day to assist drivers in deciding where to be we used nyc yellow taxi data provided by the nyc taxi and limousine commission tlc in this paper we discuss the design and results for each of these approaches and outline the next steps that would lead to a successful tool . a few groups have tried to predict nyc taxi activity and fares with a variety of features . one group used random forest regressors and k nearest neighbors regression to predict pickup density using 440 million trips recently there was a kaggle competition that attempted to solve the fare prediction problem using features such as pickup drop off locations in lat long time date and number of passengers . we cluster our location ids into 10 smaller clusters to increase the granularity of the model . a hyperparameter tuning 1 random forests we tuned the hyperparamaters of our model with the validation set . some of the parameters we tweaked include number of trees tree depth and loss criterion . c accuracy. with the predictions we were able to produce heatmaps for each of the models to visualize how they vary with region for a given day of week and time interval . specifically we applied k means to increase the granularity of our data implemented different models such as random forest fully connected neural network and long short term memory network to do the prediction . we also carried out error analysis steps to help diagnose the focus of our future work 1 extract more related features for our prediction model . 5 sample more data .
