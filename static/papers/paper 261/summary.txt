we are living in a world which is rapidly adopting digital payments systems . in third quarter of 2018 paypal inc a san jose based payments company processed 143 billion usd in total payment volume an effective fraud detection system should be able to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and efficiency . while it is necessary to prevent bad actors from executing fraudulent transactions it is also very critical to ensure genuine users are not prevented from accessing the payments system . designing an accurate and efficient fraud detection system that is low on false positives but detects fraudulent activity effectively is a significant challenge for researchers in our paper we apply multiple binary classification approaches logistic regression linear svm and svm with rbf kernel on a labeled dataset that consists of payment transactions our goal is to build binary classifiers which are able to separate fraud transactions from non fraud transactions . the paper. the training process aims to determine a hyper plane that maximizes geometric margin with respect to labeled input data . svms optimization problem can be characterized byin this project we use two variants of svm linear svm and svm based on rbf kernel . an svm based on rbf kernel can find a non linear decision boundary in input space . for each model we chose the class weights which gave us highest recall on fraud class with not more than 1 percent false positives finally we used the models trained using chosen set of class weights to make predictions on our test dataset split . we evaluated performance of our models by computing metrics like recall precision f1 score area under precision recall curve auprc . we can create user specific models which are based on user s previous transactional behavior and use them to further improve our decision making process .
