in the platforms of job marketplace like linkedin indeed and etc it is crucial for these job posting platforms to recommend desirable jobs to job seekers based on their career interests to deliver high value for both job posters and seekers to become qualified matches and ultimately serve a reliabled ecosystem of job markeplace themselves in the recommender system there are two general approaches to provide recommendations . third i will discuss the validation process compare the performances of co clustering methods with the baseline algorithm k means and demonstrate visual comparision . there are many co clustering approaches that simultaneously clustering rows and columns of a given matrix experimented on clustering documents and words . 2 . the baseline clustering method is one way clustering on users using k means . this method is proposed in if imposing orthogonality on both f and g the objective is as shown in where f is the cluster indicator matrix of row clusters and g is the cluster indicator matrix of column clusters because as described in since our user job matrices contain 0 valued entries when the corresponding user row doesn t apply to the corresponding job column i replaced 0 with a small fractional number 0 01 which can be distinctive from the 1 valued entries before running this method then implemented the following algorithm to minimize the objective function and obtain f and g algorithm nmtf initialization 1 . 3 . in addition spectral co clustering is designed to construct more balanced clusters which is more ideal for recommendation by supplying more accurate pools of jobs to recommend in the future since both co clustering methods are slow because they leverage matrix decomposition it s beneficial to explore more scalable co clustering methods so that we can co cluster efficiently on more sparse data set .
