uplift modelling has turned out to be very successful technique in understanding difference between the behaviour of a treated and a control population and this has been used as the basis for targeted direct marketing activity . for predictive response modelling and uplift modelling we used 4 models logistic regression with and without bagging three layered neural network along with decision tree to apply on a real world example . uplift modeling techniques provides a solution to this problem implying that we should only target customers who will buy because of the campaign i e those who are likely to buy if targeted but unlikely to buy otherwise . more precisely to measure uplift effect we divide the population into two groups control and exposed . the difference in their responses is used to gauge the uplift effect also as said earlier uplift modelling is unique in the sense that it s only concerned with incremental effect i e p r purchase treatment p r purchase no treatment . when a feature was represented as a one hot vector the final feature vector was the concatenation of all the one hot feature vectors and other real values features . evaluation also suffers from the same problem one single test data can not both see and not see the ad . roc curve is a plot of tpr true positive rate versus false positive rate fpr . a sample roc curve is shown in we will extend this idea to uplift modelling evaluation as well . for a single bucket we look at overall uplift rate by looking at differences in visit rate for the set of users of that bucket who saw the ad campaign and the set of users in the same bucket who didn t see the ad campaign . instead they are uplift probabilities . see.
