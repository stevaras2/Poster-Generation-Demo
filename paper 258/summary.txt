we use node2vec 3 to compute feature representations of the nodes and then apply clustering to identify improvements that should be made to the labeling system . we concluding by discussing findings involving anomaly detection identification of redundant or closely associated labels and label hierarchical organization . in a massive online store such as amazon keywords to describe books can easily be acquired by either seller input or automatic searching of the text . other works applying node2vec include node2vec in telco an application of the novel feature learning method for predictions in call networks extensions of node2vec include metapath2vec. amazon web store categories camera photo photography books photo essaysthese categories are somewhat redundant and one of the goals of our model will be to detect categories which can be merged or used to provide additional recommendations to a user . the node2vec algorithms samples a set of random walks and then performs stochastic gradient descent on the feature representation of the vertices where the loss function is the similarity of the pairs of representations given the vertices appear together . in each iteration as discussed above we use node2vec and then k means to determine optimal modules . we compared this to 3 dimensional plots and plots of other dimensions besides the principal ones but the 2 dimensional pca plots conveyed the full structure of the point set while being much more concise . we present visualizations of the label space created using two variations of our workflow . the next step that should be taken with these results is to establish a ground truth based on crowd sourced human preferences for labels since the end goal is human readability . further research could also examine optimization of node2vec parameters including search strategy . parameter tuning could also be applied to k means clustering and outlier thresholds .
