for the past 60 years the anxiety and depression medications are prescribed to patients based on the hamilton depression rating scale hdrs . healthcare professional prescribes antidepressant medications to patients based on two scores hdrs. the paper regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso by robert tibshirani. symbolically we ran different gaussian mixture models using hdrs sofas baseline score and brain data . factor analysis works on small dataset where it helps to captures the correlations in the data . assumption 1 2 is known 2 all s are independent with laplace density 3 with this prior the map estimator is the same as the lasso solution this sparse solution is useful because we have five feature variables for brain structure and we would like to establish the functional connectivity between antidepressants and brain structure so we would like to have some of the s zero 4 we search for a choice of that minimizes the objective function5 the output of bayesian linear regression on a new test point x is the posterior predictive distribution. we built several models using several variations of feature variables from our small dataset . lowest misclassification error on validation set 0 3379138 and on test set we get misclassification error of 41 . here data gets transformed in the direction of each eigenvector and represent all the new variables or factors using the eigenvalues . output of our factor loadings shows that all 11 feature variables 3 antidepressants age gender education 5 brain scan attributes adequately represent the factor categories for this medical data set svm classifier is tested using three different kernels . linear kernel 0 3745 radial kernel 0 34125 p olynomial kernel of degree2 0 37825 usage of kernel depends on the data set . we would like to enhance our gaussian mixture model with regression and sparsity.
