gene regulation in most eukaryotes is driven by the action of sequence specific transcription factors which recognize specific dna sequence motifs binding sites tfbss within larger cis regulatory elements cres and act in concert to affect the expression of their cognate genes . deep learning approaches have already demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide variety of problems in genomics 6 such as predicting transcription factor binding accessible chromatin regions nucleosome positioning rna splicing outcomes and many others and they have more recently also seen initial applications to mpras involving endogenous 7 and random sequences beyond the simple development of predictive models another highly promising deep learning based approach in this area is the generation of novel dna sequences following the what i cannot create i do not understand principle the activity of which can subsequently be tested in an mpra . we used two mpra datasets in this study . these sequences were assayed in two different human cell lines the erythroid k562 and the hepatic hepg2 with two different promoters dna sequences were one hot encoded following established practices . the best method for evaluating the quality of a generated distribution given an actual distribution is to do calculate the loo leave one out accuracy of a 1 nn algorithm in a learned feature space . the sharpr mpra dataset is significantly more difficult to predict than the yeast mpras as it exhibits poor reproducibility between the experimental replicates 7 and the between replicate correlation sets an upper limit on the achievable model performance . we are still in the process of identifying the optimal performing models for this dataset . optimal real value generated 1 nn loo 0 5 0 89 predicted expression mse 0 0 64324 5176 ation based on the promise such approaches have shown in the language generation literature .
